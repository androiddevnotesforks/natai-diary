UpdateNoteAction - done.
Tests and docs added as well.
It took me an hour to do this endpoint, idk but it seems a bit slow.
I don't want to spend 4 hours on a CRUD endpoints, but on the other hand it does contain tests and proper OpenAPI docs.
And most of the time I spent on fixing validation which is not something that I need to do often.

Today I added more tests to DeleteNoteAction and actually that helped me to fix a couple of bugs,
improved OpenAPI docs for this endpoint as well.

Next steps:

- UpdateNoteAction + tests + docs
- SyncNotesAction + tests + docs
- Would be nice to add possibility to authenticate through OpenAPI interface, but not a priority.

Last couple of weeks I'm migrating backend from Kotlin (Ktor) to PHP (Symfony) because php ecosystem way better in my opinion, a lot of tools to use that speed up the process, while in Kotlin even such simple things as autowiring with DI are not so easy to implement. Autogeneration of sql migrations also not Kotlin's strongest side, so I decided to move to PHP.

So far I have implemented:
- User registration, login, logout (+ tests and docs)
- Find all notes, create new note, delete note (+ tests and docs)

Next steps:
- Add more tests for Delete Note endpoint + fix docs
- Update note endpoint
- Sync notes with Android app + test it properly
